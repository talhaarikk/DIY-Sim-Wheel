# DIY Sim Wheel
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make a powerful sim racing wheel cheaply (also i like doing this kind of stuff). The main reason i started this project was that i didn't want to buy a logitech g29 (g29 because it is the most common, known, reliable and cheap model on the market). The reasons for this were that the g29 was made of too much plastic, its torque wasn't at the level i wanted, and the size of the steering wheel wasn't enough for me. That's why i focused on these issues in my own design. Below you can find all the details of the steering wheel.
## Motor
To be honest, when i started the project, i didn't want to make a design like the one below. I had in mind to make a direct drive sim wheel by purchasing a stepper motor with an encoder and a stepper motor driver. However, since the prices of these parts were higher ($110 for stepper motor and $110 for driver) and i couldn't see an example of a sim wheel made using with stepper motor, i decided to make this project with the motor below. My advice to you is that if you don't have a budget problem and still want to make your own sim wheel, you should continue with a servo motor. If I had used such a motor, I wouldn't have bothered with the gears, shaft or cage in this project.  
As an motor, i chose this motor which is originally used in scooters.  
Brushed DC motor. Model: MY1025  
Works with 24V and 14A (so its 250W).Also 2750RPM (actually, what i paid attention to was not the rpm but the torque).  
I think this motor will be powerful enough for the steering wheel. If you want, you can do the project by using 2 smaller motor or even using 2 of this motor. Although i didn't need such a thing.
## Power Supply

## Gears

## Frame

## Design
The thing i paid particular attention to in the design was that the shaft passes through the middle of the case. If I hadn't paid attention to this, the width of the cage could have been smaller.
## Assembly

## Electronics

## Cost
In this section, i will write the prices of the pieces in turkish lira. since my purpose in doing my projects is completely up to my enjoyment, they are spread over a long period of time like 1-2 years. That's why prices and exchange rates are variable, but as of the date i did the project, you can think of 1 dollar as 30-40 turkish lira.
Motor: 1700
