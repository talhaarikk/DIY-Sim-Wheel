# DIY Sim Wheel
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make a powerful sim racing wheel cheaply (also i like doing this kind of stuff). The main reason i started this project was that i didn't want to buy a logitech g29 (g29 because it is the most common, known, reliable and cheap model on the market). The reasons for this were that the g29 was made of too much plastic, its torque wasn't at the level i wanted, and the size of the steering wheel wasn't enough for me. That's why i focused on these issues in my own design. Below you can find all the details of the steering wheel.
